# Paradise Nursery Shopping Cart

Welcome to the **Paradise Nursery** shopping cart! This project features a dynamic shopping experience where users can browse plants, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout.

## Features

- **Landing Page:** A clean and welcoming landing page with a button linking to the product listing page.
- **Navigation Bar:** A navigation bar with links to the landing page, product listing page, and shopping cart page.
- **Product Listings:** A card for each plant showcasing its image, name, description, cost, and an "Add to Cart" button.
- **Plant Categories:** At least two sections describing various plant categories like "Aromatic Plants" and "Medicinal Plants."
- **Shopping Cart:** The cart displays each product added, with its thumbnail, unit cost, total cost, quantity adjustment buttons, and a delete button for removing items.
- **Cart Management:** Users can increase or decrease the quantity of items, and the cart updates dynamically. The total cost also updates based on quantity changes.
- **Continue Shopping & Checkout:** Buttons to either continue shopping or proceed to checkout.
